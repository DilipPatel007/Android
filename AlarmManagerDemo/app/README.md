This is a simple Android application that demonstrates using AlarmManager to schedule an alarm and play the default ringtone when it triggers.

How it works:

The user enters a desired alarm time in seconds using the EditText field in the MainActivity.
Clicking the "Set Alarm" button triggers the onClick method which:
Retrieves the user-entered time.
Calculates the alarm trigger time by adding the entered time (in seconds) to the current system time.
Creates an Intent to call the MyReceiver class when the alarm triggers.
Creates a PendingIntent that instructs the system to broadcast the Intent when the alarm fires.
Uses the AlarmManager to schedule the alarm at the calculated trigger time.
When the alarm triggers, the system broadcasts the Intent and calls the onReceive method in MyReceiver.
onReceive creates a MediaPlayer object using the default ringtone URI and sets it to loop continuously.
The MediaPlayer starts playing the ringtone, notifying the user about the alarm.
Project Structure:

The project consists of two main classes:

MainActivity: This class handles the user interface and interaction for setting the alarm.
MyReceiver: This class is a BroadcastReceiver that gets called when the alarm triggers and plays the ringtone.
Getting Started:

Clone or download the repository.
Import the project into Android Studio.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access and modify system settings (for ringtone access).
Run the app on an Android device.
Enter a desired alarm time in seconds and click "Set Alarm".

Benefits of Using BroadcastReceivers in Android
BroadcastReceivers are essential components in Android development that allow your app to respond to system events and custom broadcasts. Here are some key benefits of using BroadcastReceivers:

Lightweight and Efficient:
Activities are resource-intensive components in Android. Keeping them running in the background solely to handle alarms can drain battery and slow down the device.
BroadcastReceivers, on the other hand, are lightweight components designed specifically to receive and respond to broadcasts. They start quickly and consume fewer resources compared to Activities.
Decoupling the Alarm Logic:
By using a BroadcastReceiver, the AlarmManager in the MainActivity simply schedules the alarm and sends an Intent when it triggers.
The MyReceiver is a separate component responsible for handling the alarm event (e.g., playing the ringtone). This separation improves code organization and makes it easier to maintain and modify the alarm functionality.
Benefits of BroadcastReceivers:
Flexibility: BroadcastReceivers can be used to respond to various system events (e.g., battery low, network connectivity changes) and custom broadcasts sent by other applications.
Background Execution: They can run even when your app is in the background or completely terminated, allowing you to perform tasks without requiring a visible UI.
Low Resource Consumption: BroadcastReceivers are efficient for short-lived tasks like handling alarms, ensuring minimal impact on system performance.
